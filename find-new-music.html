    <section class="intro">
      <p class="center-text large-text">
        Art is perspective. Every new musical experience offers a window into a different way of hearing, thinking, and expressing. Perspective manifests in every art form‚Äîvisual, literary, or musical. In music, perspective appears in harmony, dynamics, stereo imaging, or lyrical content. Offering perspective‚Äîwhether expanding the listener‚Äôs mind or creating emotional connection‚Äîis what gives art its unique power.
      </p>

      <p class="center-text large-text">
        Discovering new music is like trying new foods or exploring different cultures. It can be scary at first and requires effort, but the payoff is immense. By challenging yourself to step outside familiar genres, you gain new tools, ideas, and inspiration for your own compositions.

      <h2 class="section-title">Stepping Outside Your Comfort Zone</h2>
      <p class="large-text">
        Expanding your musical horizons is like learning a new type of cuisine. Each genre demands different techniques‚Äîmetal requires blast beats and fast picking, reggae uses swing and skanking. Exploring unfamiliar genres strengthens your versatility and unlocks new ways to approach music.
      </p>
      <p class="large-text">
        A personal example: I recently studied <em>‚ÄúHead Over Heels‚Äù</em> by Tears for Fears. As a pop song, I had never analyzed it deeply, but it unlocked modal interchange and key modulation techniques that I applied in my own track <em>‚ÄúSuch an Angel.‚Äù</em> Even unexpected genres can teach you something valuable.

    <section class="analysis">
      <h2 class="section-title">Theory Emerges from Expression</h2>
      <p class="large-text">
        After training my ears in music theory‚Äîidentifying tonal centers, intervals, and harmonic relationships‚ÄîI naturally analyze what I hear. This helps me spot techniques, harmonies, and structures that can inspire my work. Simple or minimalistic music may challenge me at first, but it often contains insights I can use creatively.
      </p>
      <p class="large-text">
        Across genres, theory often emerges organically: pop music emphasizes harmonic color and lush textures, while technical death metal explores complexity and virtuosity. Recognizing these patterns allows me to borrow ideas without losing my own voice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="application">
      <h2 class="section-title">Applying Lessons to My Music</h2>
      <p class="large-text">
        Voice comes from your unique perspective. Just like vocal cords, it needs exercise, not restriction. By studying, practicing, and experimenting across genres, I develop a personal musical language. Applying techniques learned from different styles keeps my compositions fresh and expressive.
      </p>
      <p class="large-text">
        Discovering new music also taught me the importance of pacing and impact. Pop songs structure moments of tension and release to maintain engagement. I applied this insight to my progressive death metal EP <em>‚ÄúRend and Ruin‚Äù</em>, structuring six parts to keep every moment compelling.
      </p>

    <section class="conclusion">
      <h2 class="section-title">Perspective is Everything</h2>
      <p class="large-text">
        Discovering new music isn‚Äôt just about enjoyment‚Äîit‚Äôs about growth and perspective. Exploring unfamiliar genres challenges your thinking, expands your creative toolkit, and opens opportunities for connection. The next time you want to <strong>find new music</strong>, seek songs that push your boundaries and inspire your own creations.
