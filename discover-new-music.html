    <p>For me, the best place to listen to music is in my car. There’s something about the acoustics and the act of driving that pulls my focus away from everything else and lets me hear in ways I normally wouldn’t. It’s almost like the road itself helps me listen differently.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, I don’t usually hunt for new music—it tends to find me. When I do actively search, I’m skeptical of recommendations unless they come from friends who are musically inclined. Algorithms and “packaged” music aesthetics often turn me off. Scrolling through new music can feel like walking through a mall, and frankly, it sometimes makes me sick.</p>

    <h2>How I Discover New Music</h2>
    <p>Musically inclined friends are my secret weapon. They get my taste in a way that no algorithm ever could and are constantly digging for new, unique, and interesting tracks. I have a diverse palate—progressive music taught me to embrace genre-bending—so I’m open to almost anything. For streaming, I just use whatever service I’m paying for at the time, but it’s really the recommendations from trusted friends that lead me to gems.</p>

    <h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
    <p>When a song hits me, it’s often because it’s experimental or virtuosic. I get tingles down my spine when I hear someone not just playing with technical mastery, but truly understanding the music inside and out. Bands like <strong>TOOL, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Animals As Leaders, TesseracT</strong>, and <strong>Karnivool</strong> recently have all sparked that level of excitement in me. Songs like Karnivool’s <em>Aozora</em> and <em>Drone</em> make me want to pick up my guitar and start writing immediately.</p>

    <h2>From Inspiration to Composition</h2>
    <p>Once inspired, I usually combine improvisation with structured songwriting. I’ll let my hands explore riffs for a minute, repeat what works, create variations, and start shaping motifs and contrasting parts. Then I’ll take it into Cubase and start recording. Sometimes, I’ll even take someone else’s work as a kind of academic exercise—rewriting it in my own voice. But when I’m crafting an original piece, I focus on my own emotions, letting the music grow from there.</p>

    <p>A recent example: I discovered a classical guitarist on YouTube whose technique and exercises completely changed the way I approach both fingerstyle and metal. Within 45 minutes, I realized I should have studied classical and fingerstyle from the start. Since then, I’ve been writing classical pieces and blending those techniques into my instrumental metal compositions.</p>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p>Progressive music hits me the hardest, closely followed by metal, classical, and jazz. In the past, discovering new artists was easy—tuning the radio often led to surprises. Today, most music discovery happens through social media noise, but diamonds in the rough still exist. The key is to listen broadly. Every style has lessons, even pop, which I generally dislike. Studying pop taught me how minimalism, harmony, and impactful moments can keep listeners engaged—even in the most complex progressive pieces.</p>

    <p>In short: listen widely, explore deeply, and never stop learning. Every song you find has the potential to teach you something, inspire you, and ultimately help shape your own original music.</p>
