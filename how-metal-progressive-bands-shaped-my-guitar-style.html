  <main>
    <p>I discovered progressive metal at the age of 10, back in 2001. My first spark came from <em>Tool</em>—hearing <em>Lateralus</em> on the radio made me realize I wanted to be a musician. The intricate rhythms and layered textures of that track changed the way I thought about music. Seeing them live in 2008 cemented that inspiration and showed me what was possible on stage.</p>

    <p>From that moment, progressive metal became my lens for exploring music. It wasn’t just about admiring the complexity—I wanted to create it myself. I wanted to write riffs, structure songs, and craft arrangements that lived up to the genre’s intensity and emotion.</p>

    <h2>Key Bands That Inspired Me</h2>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve drawn inspiration from some of the most innovative prog bands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Porcupine Tree</strong> – Their dynamic shifts and atmospheric textures taught me how to build tension and release in a song.</li>
      <li><strong>Karnivool</strong> – Their approach to rhythm and groove helped me make complex timings feel natural.</li>
      <li><strong>TesseracT</strong> – Their use of polyrhythms and ambient passages influenced my layering and tonal choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Animals as Leaders</strong> – Watching Tosin Abasi’s technique pushed me to explore fingerstyle, tapping, and extended-range guitars.</li>
      <li><strong>Opeth</strong> – Their mastery of dynamics, modal interplay, and progressive song structures informed my own compositions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For years, I analyzed their songs, rewrote them, and recorded my versions. This practice helped me internalize progressive structures, odd meters, polyrhythms, and the nuances that make a prog metal riff feel both technical and musical.</p>

    <h2>How I Apply These Techniques in My Tracks</h2>
    <p>Now, I take these influences and filter them through my own voice. Here’s what I focus on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Structure & Arrangement:</strong> I map out compositions that balance tension, rhythm changes, and melodic arcs.</li>
      <li><strong>Riffs in Odd Timings:</strong> Mixed meters, polyrhythms, and polymeters give my riffs complexity without losing musicality.</li>
      <li><strong>Modal Harmony & Interchange:</strong> Modes provide distinctive colors and emotional depth to my compositions.</li>
      <li><strong>Guitar Techniques:</strong> Fingerstyle, double-tap, and hybrid picking add texture and versatility to my riffs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every song I write is a combination of these techniques, filtered through my own ideas and creativity. The goal is to honor progressive metal while creating something distinctly my own.</p>

    <h2>Why This Music Matters to Me</h2>
    <p>Progressive metal isn’t just a genre—it’s a way of thinking. Complexity, odd meters, and layered harmonies aren’t for show—they’re the shape of my thoughts. Writing this music gives me permission to explore emotion, tension, and melody without compromise.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever searched for <em>metal progressive bands</em> or wanted to dive into the mechanics behind the riffs, I hope you’ll connect with what I’m building—not just as a fan, but as a creator contributing to the scene.</p>

    <h2>Join Me in the Journey</h2>
    <p>Whether you’re a fellow musician, a fan of progressive metal, or just discovering the genre—I invite you to explore my work. Listen, watch, and maybe find a riff or a melody that speaks to you.</p>
