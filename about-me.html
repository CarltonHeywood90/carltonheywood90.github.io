  <p>
    Brutal Honesty, Relentless Drive (BHRD) is hope without expectation. It’s about being honest with yourself about where you are and your prospects — but still charging toward your goals with relentless determination.
  </p>

  <p>
    BHRD’s music is <strong>instrumental progressive metal</strong>, blending theory, technique, groove, brutality, and the unique personalities of its members to create chaotic, immersive soundscapes. Every riff, rhythm, and crescendo is designed to push boundaries — both musically and mentally.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core message is simple: <strong>Go for it.</strong> Whether you’re facing obstacles in life or in art, BHRD’s music is a soundtrack for perseverance. Borrow the intensity of the sound to build momentum and keep moving forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Current members include <strong>Max Dail</strong> on drums and <strong>Carlton Heywood</strong> on guitar. BHRD is actively seeking a bassist to complete the lineup and expand its sonic impact.
