  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem;">
    Hi, Iâ€™m Carlton Heywood â€” a lifelong musician with a passion for crafting both evocative guitar compositions and nostalgic 8-bit soundscapes. My musical journey began at age eleven when I joined the band program in middle school. After that, I expanded my experience by joining a bagpipe program and diving deep into music theory and composition during high school. Using the knowledge I gained from these experiences, I started teaching myself to play guitar, blending formal education with self-driven exploration.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem;">
    I create original music not just to fill the silence, but to tell stories â€” stories that inspire, energize, and sometimes comfort. Whether itâ€™s a driving guitar riff or a carefully crafted chiptune loop, my goal is to connect with listeners and fellow creators in meaningful ways.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem;">
    When Iâ€™m not composing, Iâ€™m usually tinkering with new sounds, collaborating with other artists, or exploring whatever new ideas catch my curiosity. Iâ€™d love for you to join me on this creative journey â€” check out my music, follow my channels, and say hi anytime!
