        Thereâ€™s something intoxicating about progressive metalâ€”the shifting time signatures, the emotional depth, the sense that music can still surprise you. I grew up obsessed with bands like <em>Tool</em>, <em>Karnivool</em>, <em>TesseracT</em>, and <em>Animals as Leaders</em>. But over time, I found myself wanting something moreâ€”not just as a listener, but as a creator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Progressive metal bands challenged my ear. But I didnâ€™t just want to admire themâ€”I wanted to join them. Or, better yet, <strong>create something of my own</strong> that lived up to that complexity, intensity, and catharsis.
      </p>

      <h2>What Does It Mean to Be a Prog Metal Band Today?</h2>
      <p>
        Progressive metal has evolved. The genre isnâ€™t just about odd time signatures or concept albums anymore. Itâ€™s about emotion, texture, and atmosphereâ€”and still about technical firepower.
      </p>

      <p>
        I donâ€™t tour with a band (yet), but I am one. Thatâ€™s the heart of this project: I write, perform, and produce progressive metal songs that are deeply personal, emotionally intense, and unconcerned with fitting into neat genre boxes. I donâ€™t try to sound like other prog metal bands. I just try to <strong>mean every note</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>My Sound: Melodic Complexity and Relentless Honesty</h2>
      <p>
        My current project blends intricate guitar work with layered textures, electronic elements, and programmed drums. I recently started working with Max, a longtime friend and absurdly talented musician (drummer). Together, we hope to capture something I think deserves to be in the same sentence as the prog metal bands we grew up on.

        This track was born out of frustrationâ€”with the world, with the industry, with myself. But like most progressive metal, the point isnâ€™t to wallowâ€”itâ€™s to <em>transform</em> that emotion into something honest and powerful. Something that punches hard but lingers with melody.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I Write Songs Like This</h2>
      <p>
        Because complexity is honesty.<br>
        Because I donâ€™t believe in shortcuts.<br>
        Because prog metal is one of the few genres that invites obsession.
      </p>

      <p>
        The odd meters and layered harmonies arenâ€™t just for showâ€”theyâ€™re <strong>the shape of my thoughts</strong>. And this music gives me permission to not sand off the edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        If youâ€™ve ever been the kind of person who listens to the same 90-second riff 30 times to figure out whatâ€™s really going onâ€”youâ€™ll probably connect with what Iâ€™m building.
      </p>

      <p>
        If youâ€™ve ever searched for <em>new prog metal bands</em> or <em>emerging progressive metal artists</em>, I hope youâ€™ll consider what Iâ€™m doing not just as a fanâ€”but as part of the scene.
      </p>

      <h2>Letâ€™s Build Something Real</h2>
      <p>
        Whether youâ€™re a fellow musician, a fan of progressive metal bands, or someone just discovering the genreâ€”I invite you to dive into my work, give it a listen, and maybe find something that speaks to you.
